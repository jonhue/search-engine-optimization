## Usage

### Meta tags

Use [metamagic](https://github.com/lassebunk/metamagic) to add titles and descriptions to your views.

### Schemas

Search Engine Optimization assists you in creating schema tags that will enhance SERPs and click rates.

Use the `seo/schema` component:

```haml
= component 'seo/schema', type: :article, options
```

Here is a list of available types:

* [AggregateRating](components/schema/types/aggregate_rating.md)
* [Article](components/schema/types/article.md)
* [Brand](components/schema/types/brand.md)
* [CreativeWork](components/schema/types/creative_work.md)
* [Intangible](components/schema/types/intangible.md)
* [Offer](components/schema/types/offer.md)
* [Organization](components/schema/types/organization.md)
* [Person](components/schema/types/person.md)
* [Product](components/schema/types/product.md)
* [Rating](components/schema/types/rating.md)
* [Service](components/schema/types/service.md)
* [Thing](components/schema/types/thing.md)

#### Nested types

You can nest types in your schema tag:

```haml
= component 'seo/schema', type: :person, name: 'Parent', children: [{ type: :person, name: 'Child 1' }, { type: :person, name: 'Child 2' }], parent: { type: :person, name: 'Grandparent' }
```
